polymorphism
poly - multiple
morph - forms
multiple forms of one task

when single task can be performed in different multiple ways then all these methods can be written with same name and different parameter list (no of parameters, sequence of parameters/type of parameters ) 

static polymorphism/ compile-time binding
constructor overloading
when multiple constructors are written in a class it is example of polymorphiam, because all the constructors will have same name and different parameter list. moreover they are used to perform single task of instance-variable initialization in different ways.
this is called as constructor overloading.

method overloading
when single task that can be done in different ways is represented with same methodname and different parameter list then it is called as method overloading
e.g. you have drawn an object say circle. now you want to paint it.
paint is the task
way1 - paint with specific colour like blue
	public void paint(String colour) /
way2 - paint with RGB combination
	public void paint(int r, int g,int b)
way3 - paint with colour code
	public void paint(String code,int dummy)

method overloading is not allowed or recognized by difference in return data type.
