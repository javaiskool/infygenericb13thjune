when a method is declared as abstract the class also becomes abstract and it is to be prefixed with abstract keyword.
abstract class may have zero or more abstract methods. it can have concrete methods.
abstract class cannot be instanciated. 
its functionalities are to be used through inheritance. 
if an abstract class has abstract method then the child class has to provide the definition of the abstract methods (override the abstract methods) , else the child class also becomes abstract.
