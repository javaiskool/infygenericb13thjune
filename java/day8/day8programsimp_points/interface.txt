interface
complete designer class
all the methods in an interface are abstract methods.
all the variable in an interface are public, static, final
multiple inheritance is supported only in case of interfaces in Java
interface cannot be instranciated. its design is to be used through inheritance.
this is to implement the design provided by an interface while designing classes.
for inheriting interface the keyword used is implements
the child class has to provide definition of all the methods from the interface, else the child class becomes abstract

interface interfacename
{

method signature declaration;
constant declaration

}

class classname implements interfacename
{

definitions for all methods in interface

}


inheritance
interface to interface => extends
class to class => extends
interface to class => implements
