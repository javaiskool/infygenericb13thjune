Object is implicit superclass os all the classes i.e. inbuilt class as well as user defined classes

toString() => to provide text representation of the object
S.o.p. (object); => by default displayes classname@code
it can be overridden to display meaningful and useful info. about class


comparing objects
==   compares memory address
equals() by default compares memory address
in built in classes like String, Integer (wrapper classes) it is overriden to compare contents 
it can be overridden in UDD (class)

hashCode() compare on the basis of the hashcode generated for each object.
it can be overridden in UDD (class)
it is faster
