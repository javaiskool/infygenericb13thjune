**till now we have used queries on single table
real life scenario there will be nultiple tables related to each other. the relation is established through foreign key constraint. or even multiple tables not related with foreign key. 

**to access the data from multiple tables together we will use
union/interestion/minus
joins
subqueries


join queries work on multiple tables related to each other

inner join - works on join condition for matching tuples
outer join - 
self join - works on same table considered twice


cross join / cartesian product- each tuple of one table is extracted with each tuple of second table. so it produces the resultset tuples=tuples in table1 * tuples in table2

select columnlist_from_both_table_with_alias from table_name1 alias1 , table_name2 alias2 
select columnlist_from_both_tables_with_alias from table1 alias1 inner join table2 alias2 on join_condition

dept(dno,dname) => no. of tuples =3
emp(eno,ename,sal,dno) => no. of tuples=10

select dno,dname,eno,ename from dept,emp 
select dno,dname,eno,ename from dept cross join emp
no. of rows in output =3*10=30

inner join 
each tuple in table1 is matched with each tuple in second table based on join condition. if match found the data from respective tuples is fetched as specified in select clause

select dept.dno,dname,eno,ename from dept,emp where dept.dno=emp.dno
select dept.dno,dname,eno,ename from dept inner join emp on dept.dno=emp.dno

select d.dno,dname,eno,ename from dept d,emp e where d.dno=e.dno
select d.dno,dname,eno,ename from dept d inner join emp e on d.dno=e.dno
