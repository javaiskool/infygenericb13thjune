data
discrete precise values

database
store data, manipulate data, retrieve data 
safety & security
user access control
backup & recovery

dbms database mnagement system

data -> information -> knowledge

mothematical model statistical model analytical model

data mining

models
hierarchical - inverted tree structure i.e. root at the top and branchs spreading downwards

network  - nodes and arcs to maintain connections

relational- tabular that contains tables/relations where the data is stored in terms of rows & columns

NoSql - not only SQL  (key-value pair, graph, tagged documents)


relational model
data is stored inrelations/ tables in terms of rows/tuples and columns/attributes
relationship between tables is maintained in tables themselves
relation (table) - tuple (record/row)- attribute (field/column)
cardinality(number of tuples in a relation)
degree (number of attributes in a relation)
domain (set of permitted values for an attribute)
null - means nothing

integrity - accuracy and consistency
entity integrity - unique tuple identification - enforced through primary key
domain integrity - specific type of values and permitte set of values (domain, range) - enforce through data-type, check constraint
referencial integrity - relationship between the tables - enforced through foreign key constraint  - primary key attribute or unique attribute of parent table is made foreign key attribute in child table

ACID properties (Atomicity,Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
CODD's rules
normalization and de-normalization
