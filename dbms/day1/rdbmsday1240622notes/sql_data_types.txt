CHAR(SIZE)/CHARACTER(SIZE)
PRE DETERMINED LENGTH ATTRIBUTES E.G. DEPTNAME(3) ACC,MKT,DEV
GENDER CHAR(1) M, F

SNAME(50)
SIZE IS 50. SO IT WILL OCCUPY 50 BYTES WHETHER OR NOT THE DATA OCCUPIES THE SIZE

NUMBER(P,S)/NUMERIC(P,S)
PRECISION IS INCLUSIVE OF SCALE
NUMBER(7,2) => P=5 INTEGRAL PART (7-2=5) DIGIT MAX 
SCALE=2  DECIMAL PART 2 DIGITS MAX
IF DECIMAL PART IS > SCALE IT IS ROUNDED OFF
IF INTEGRAL PART IS >P-S THEN IT GIVES ERROR
SCALE CAN BE NEGATIEV THEN IT WILL ROUND OFF AS -1 TO NEAREST TEHTH, -2 NEAREST HUNDREDTH AND SO ON

NUMBER(8,0) => INTEGRAL PART 8, SCALE 0
12345, 56789.67 56790, 123456789 ERROR

NUMBER(5,2) => I (5-2=3) DIGITS S 2 DIGITS
123.23 , 123.123 123.12, 1234.1 ERROR 
NUMER(5,-2) => I ROUNDED OFF TO NEAREST HUNDREDTH
