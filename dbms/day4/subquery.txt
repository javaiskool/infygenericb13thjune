**WE CANNOT USE AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS IN WHERE CLAUSE
** WHEN WE AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS WE CANNOT DISPLAY DETAIL INFORMATION

REQUIREMENT : DISPLAY EMPLOYEENO,EMPNAMES WHO ARE GETTING SALARY MORE THAN AVERAGE SALARY 

select avg(sal) from emp => 52000
selecct eno,ename from emp where sal>52000
can i write songle statement for above requirement? yes
using subquery
select eno,ename from emp where sal>(select avg(sal) from emp)
1. execution of inner query =>select avg(sal) from emp => 52000
2. substitution of inner query result inthe outer query => selecct eno,ename from emp where sal>52000
3. execution of outer query

query within a query
subquery should be enclosed in ()

select, from, where, having

select & from used rarely

where clause very frequently
two types independent subquery, correlated subquery

outer query and inner query can be excuted independently
inner query is executed first, its result is substituted in the outer query and then the outer query is executed.




** subquery

** query nested in another query. 

** subquey should be written in ()

** subquery can be used in select, from, where, having clause

** subquery in select, from is rarely used

** subquery in select clause can return single value(single row & single column) and should have alias name
	for example fetching detailed and aggregate data together for each row
	the generated value is shown as additional attribute for each resultant row

** subquery in from clause is called as inline view and should have alias name
	subquery filters specified columns from the table which are used by parent query


** subquey in where, having are of two types
independent subquery, correlated subquery


** independent subquery

** inner and outer query can be executed independently

** independent subquery may reurn single row or multiple rows


** single row independent subquery uses = operator for comparison
	example with where clause
	SELECT Id, EName, Salary, Dept FROM Employee E1 WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee E2)

	example with having clause ( aggregate functions) nesting of aggregate functions can be upto 2 levels 
SELECT DEPT FROM Employee GROUP BY DEPT HAVING SUM(Salary) = (SELECT MAX(SUM(Salary)) FROM Employee GROUP BY Dept)

** multiple row independent subquery uses in operator   for comparison
SELECT CompId, Make, Model FROM Computer WHERE CompId IN (SELECT CompId FROM Employee);


** if independent subquery uses IN clause to fetch foreign keys from another table, it can be replaced by join.
SELECT C.CompId, Make, Model FROM Computer C, Employee E WHERE E.CompId = C.CompId


** if select caluse fetches data from columns of multiple tables then it can be written with join not subquery

** attributes from subquery cannot be accessed in outer query

** if where clause uses aggregate function then it can be written using subquery not join
